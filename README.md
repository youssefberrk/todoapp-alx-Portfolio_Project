# Todo App

## Overview

The **Todo App** is a simple and intuitive task management application built with React. It allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, helping them stay organized and productive. This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in React development and frontend design.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Update task details easily with the edit functionality.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete:** Keep track of completed tasks with a simple toggle.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

   git clone [https://github.com/youssefberrk/todoapp-alx-Portfolio_Project.git]
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**: Contains all the source code for the app.
  - **`components/`**: Includes reusable React components like `Header`, `Todo`, `TodoList`, and `TodoItem`.
  - **`App.js`**: The main component that renders the overall application structure.
  - **`App.css`**: Global styles for the app.
  - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the application.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped and modular CSS styling.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For basic layout and styling.
- **Trello/Kanban Board**: Used for project management and task tracking.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the fundamentals of React, including component-based architecture.
- Gain experience in managing state and props within a React application.
- Learn how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Explore responsive design principles and how to apply them in React projects.
- Practice using Trello for project management and task organization.

## Challenges

- Ensuring the application is fully responsive across all devices.
- Managing state effectively as the application grows.
- Handling edge cases in task management, such as dealing with empty input fields or preventing duplicate tasks.

## Schedule of Work

This project was planned and executed using a Trello board, which helped organize tasks and track progress over a 4-week period. Key milestones included setting up the project structure, implementing core features, styling the app, and conducting user testing.

## Mockups

Mockups of the Todo App were created during the design phase to visualize the layout and user experience. These guided the development process and ensured a consistent design.
